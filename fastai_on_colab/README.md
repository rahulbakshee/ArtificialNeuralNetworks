my understanding of fastai course part-1 version-3

Hi all, I will be trying to learn and implement the famous fastai Deep Learning course part-1 version-3 by Jeremy Howard. The goal is to learn and get hands dirty in Deep Lerarning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and many more areas.

The fastai library uses pytorch at backend. As I didn’t have budget to buy a deep learning rig or rent cloud solutions, I will be using google colab which provides free “limited”  CPU/GPU/TPU instances and same jupyter-like environment as Anaconda.
