## TensorFlow 1.x Basics -

>This Repository consists of TensorFlow Tutorials for the beginners who are starting with the basics and want to play around with its capabilities in machine learning and data science. 

> We will start with basic hello world programme and gradually move on to some real world problems.

### About TensorFlow from  https://www.tensorflow.org/
> TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent  mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
